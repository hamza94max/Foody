# Foody
An android app that use [Food Api](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to display different categories of food 

## Architecture
The architecture of this application relies and complies with the following points below:
- __Clean Architecture__,: into 3 layers ui, data, domain
- __A single-activity architecture__, using the Navigation Components to manage fragment operations.
- __Pattern Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)__ which facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
- __Android architecture components__ which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.
